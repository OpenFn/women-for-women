### 2. There are 'production' and 'test' versions of the jobs configured on OpenFn.org. Turn on the `[PROD]` jobs to sync with the live production environment. Choose to keep the `[TEST]` jobs running in parallel for testing purposes.

# Committed Giving <> Salesforce Integration
## 1. Solution Overview
Women for Women International would like to integrate Committed Giving with Salesforce. OpenFn will sync donation data from Committed Giving to Salesforce. In addition, OpenFn to perform duplicate checking before upserting data.

‚≠êüìñ **[See this Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qs3e3DcnI8Q9UxDlvBgyXdmenP5NYhED)** for the compiled solution documentation and diagrams. 

### Functional Summary
Flow: Committed Giving --> Salesforce
1. Weekly, OpenFn will extract CSV exports of donation data from SFTP server, convert to JSON.
2. OpenFn will map the converted CSVs to relevant Salesforce objects according to data element mapping specifications defined by WfWI.
3. OpenFn to perform duplicate checking before upserting data in Salesforce.
4. Manage ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for Recurring Donations in Salesforce (scheduling and closing where appropriate, according to business rules defined by the WFW UK Fundraising team). 


## 2. Technical Overview
### Data Flow
See data flow here https://lucid.app/lucidchart/34c8100a-42d2-47ab-8a5a-6c406a744ed8/edit?beaconFlowId=53F1EDFE7A9CEC2A&page=0_0#

### Data Mappings
[See the V2 spec](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_vg4OUB2S0wFLj7a_7xlbxTweAQSL4WjPJLdvvazkow/edit#gid=544330146) for the latest detailed documentation on the current field mapping logic. 

The CSV files map to these Salesforce objects as shown below:
1. `Donors` CSV triggers `upsertDonors.js` job, which checks for duplicates and upserts Salesforce objects `Contact` (This also looks up `Accounts`). 

2. `Direct Debit`	CSV triggers `upsertDirectDebits.js` job, which upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donations` and `Opportunity`.

3. `Transaction-DD`	CSV triggers `upsertTransactionDD.js` job, which upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donation` and `Opportunity`. 

4. `Custom DD details`	CSV triggers `upsertCustomDD.js` job, which upserts Salesforce object `Opportunity`.

5. `Card master` CSV triggers `upsertCardMaster.js` job, which upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donation` and `Opportunity`.

6. `Transaction-card` CSV triggers `upsertTransactionCards.js` job, which upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donation` and `Opportunity`.

7. `Custom CC details` CSV triggers `upsertCustomCC.js` job, which upserts Salesforce object `Opportunity`


### Unique Identifiers
1. **Contacts**: `Legacy_Supporter_ID__c` comes from `PersonRef`.

2. **Recurring Donations**: 

   For direct debits, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `PrimKey`+`DDId`.
   
   For card master, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `PrimKey`+`CardMasterID`.
   
   For transactions DD, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `PrimKey`+`DDRefforBank`.
   
   For transactions card, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `PrimKey`+`CardMasterID`+`TransactionReference`.


3. **Opportunity**: 

 For card master, configured External ID `CG_Pledged_Donation_ID__c` comes from `CardMasterID`, `RecurringCancelDate`, `Occurrence`, `LastCredited`, `NextDate`
 
 For transaction cards, configured External ID `CG_Pledged_Donation_ID__c` comes from `CardMasterID`+`Transaction Date`+ "Pledged". 

 For direct debits, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `DDid`+`CancelDate`+`PaymentFrequency`+`LastClaimDate`+`NextDate`.
 
 For transactions DD, configured External ID `Committed_Giving_ID__c` comes from `DDid`+`Date`+"Pledged".


### OpenFn Jobs
1. Job 1 gets the CSV files from Committed Giving and converts them to JSON. CSV files include: `Donors`, `Direct Debit`, `Transaction-card`,	`Transaction-DD`, `Custom CC details`	and `Custom DD details`	. See link to this job: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/1.fetchJSON.js 

2. The `upsertDonors.js` job  checks for duplicates and upserts Salesforce objects `Contact`. Link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertDonors.js

3. The`upsertDirectDebits.js` job upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donations` and `Opportunity. This job also does the following: 1) marks Open Ended Status as "Closed" on Recurring Donations to deactivate NPSP automation 2)schedules future ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities & 3) closes future ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for canceled recurring donations. Link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertDirectDebits.js

4. The `upsertTransactionDD.js` job upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donation`. Salesforce automatically creates related `Opportunity` and `Payment`. This job also 1)marks ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù transactions as ‚ÄúClosed Lost‚Äù & 2)marks ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for ‚Äúpaid‚Äù transactions as ‚ÄúClosed Won‚Äù. Link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertTransactionDD.js

5. The `upsertCustomDD.js` job  upserts Salesforce object `Opportunity`. link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertCustomDD.js

6. The `upsertCardMaster.js` job,  upserts the Salesforce object `Recurring Donation` then Salesforce automatically  creates related Salesforce Objects `Opportunity` and `Payment`. This also job does the following: 1) marks Open Ended Status as "Closed" on Recurring Donations to deactivate NPSP automation 2)schedules future ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities & 3) closes future ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for canceled recurring donations. Link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertCardMaster.js

7. The`upsertTransactionCards.js`  upserts Salesforce object `Recurring Donation` of Type `Sponsorship`, if the amount is a multiple of 22. Otherwise, it upserts Salesforce objects `Recurring Donation` of Type `Recurring Donation` and creates Salesforce object `Opportunity` with `Stage` of `Closed Won`.  In addition, if the amount is NOT a multiple of 22 and the count of transactions on a card master is more than one, it creates the Salesforce object `Opportunity` with a `Donation Type` of `General Giving` and `Stage` of `Closed Won`. This job also 1)marks ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for ‚Äúunpaid‚Äù transactions as ‚ÄúClosed Lost‚Äù & 2)marks ‚Äúpledged‚Äù Opportunities for ‚Äúpaid‚Äù transactions as ‚ÄúClosed Won‚Äù. Link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertTransactionCards.js

8. The `upsertCustomCC.js` job upserts Salesforce object `Opportunity`. link here: https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/committed/upsertCustomCC.js

### Flow Triggers
Trigger Type: Message Filter
A message filter trigger has been configured for each above. The job will run when a CSV file with the matching message filter is received in the project inbox. 

### OpenFn Adaptors
 SFTP adaptor and Salesforce adaptor

## Email Alerts

**OpenFn will send automated email notifiers if:**
1. Duplicate donors were detected in the latest Committed Giving export ‚Üí this requires WFW UK team action; they must merge dupe donors in CG
2. Any of the Committed Giving file exports were not uploaded to the SFTP server before the daily OpenFn sync at 10 PM UTC ‚Üí this alert will be sent to the CG support team (WFW admins may want to follow up on this to make sure there is a response). An email alert will not be triggered if an empty file is posted to the SFTP server (only if the file is missing altogether).


### Administrator Notes
1. This integration automates a complex donor duplicate-check flow before upserting Salesforce `Contacts`. Please see [this diagram: CG <> Salesforce Contact Integration Flow] https://lucid.app/lucidchart/4d0b44a8-3299-431f-84b5-4b00bc713cd7/edit?beaconFlowId=BD5CBE391A037FF2&page=yw0MswWCJIR2#  for a summary of the WfWI CG Contacts Duplicate Checking & Sync Logic. 

2. We assume that Committed Giving will name the CSV files with the following keywords: 
      `wfwi donors'
      'wfwi card master'
      'wfwi direct debits'
      'wfwi transactions - cards'
      'wfwi transactions - dd'
      'wfwi custom cc fields'
      'wfwi custom dd fields'
      
 3. New campaign codes will be added directly in Salesforce.

 4. All donations prior to 01/01/2020 should be logged in Salesforce already.

 5. For every `Recurring Donation` created, Salesforce automatically creates  related `Opportunity` and `Payment`.

# Bamboo <> HR Integration
## 1. Solution Overview

[See here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKgb-UiTcMg&feature=youtu.be&hd=1) for the video walkthrough of the OpenFn setup. 

### Functional Summary
This solution enables Women for Women administrators to automate employee registration processes to save time syncing data between their `BambooHR` system and `Microsoft Azure AD` (via the `Microsoft Graph API`). 

OpenFn configured a prototype integration to pilot this data flow by first focusing on automation for new Employee registrations & updates. In subsequent phases, we may expand this automation to handle other employee scenarios (i.e., employee termination, contractor employees, etc.).

Please see this data diagram for a review of the solution: [Data Flow Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/3da00134-e1d3-4a10-9bed-ada88e89c4fd/edit?page=TDoNVVxjmfJp#?folder_id=home&browser=icon)

### BambooHR Webhook Notification
BambooHR has a webhook notification service that will send OpenFn real-time notifications when changes are made to employee records in Bamboo. The fields included in this notification & how they map to Azure are listed in [this mapping specification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WNLa01o5ch2xFqVu_6tlUsvHOas-zqlKgJsi9QYWmU/edit#gid=1713086939). 

### Administrator Notes
Depending on the Employment Status, different actions may be taken beyond Azure user record updates. 
1. New Employees --> Sent a "Welcome Email"
2. Terminated Employees --> Helpdesk sent an email 
3. Employees marked as "Other" --> OpenFn logs a message in "Activity History" noting that "Employment Status does not qualify for integration." 
4. Only employee records belonging to Divisions specified as **`Active Divisions`** will be processed by the automation flow. Otherwise, the automation will skip over the record and log `No Azure action taken`. Skip to `02:08` in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKgb-UiTcMg&t=2m8s) for instructions on updating the `activeDivision` list, and please update the following lines in these jobs: 
- `1. Upsert Azure User` - [see L292](https://www.openfn.org/projects/p56pxp/jobs/jvebjm) (`const activeDivisions = ['Headquarters', 'Headquarters - PM Access'];`)
https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/production/upsertUserProd.js#L292
- `2A. Send Welcome Email` - [see L16](https://www.openfn.org/projects/p56pxp/jobs/jyjxb8)
https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/production/sendWelcomeEmailProd.js#L16
- `2B. Send Supervisor Email` - [see L16](https://www.openfn.org/projects/p56pxp/jobs/jvrqek)
https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/production/sendSupervisorEmailProd.js#L16
- `3. Send Inactive Employee Email` - [see L16](https://www.openfn.org/projects/p56pxp/jobs/jv9nxn)
https://github.com/OpenFn/women-for-women/blob/master/jobs/production/sendInactiveEmailProd.js#L16

## 2. Technical Overview
### Data Flow
For this pilot integration setup, OpenFn will sync BambooHR `Employee` information with AzureAD `users` in a one-directional data flow.  This includes automation to execute the following actions in Azure: 
1. Upsert `users`
2. Assign a `manager`
3. Add `user` as a member to `administrativeUnits`
4. Add `user` as a member to `groups` (and thereby assign licenses)

### OpenFn Logs & Errors
1.  When POST succeeds: 
    `Authentication successful`
2.  When manager assigned:
    `Assigning ${fields['First name Last name']} (${employee.fields.Employee #} to manager ${supervisorEmail} ...`
3.  When assigned manager not found:
    `Manager ${employee.fields['Supervisor email']} not found...`
4.  When member removed from an administrative unit:
    `Removing member from the administrative unit ${value[0]}...`
5.  When member added to an administrative unit:
    `Adding member to the administrative units ${employee.fields.Division}...`
6.  When member removed from group:
    `Removing member from the group ${value[0]}...`
7.  When member added to group:
    `Adding member to the group ${employee.fields['Email User Type']}...`
8.  When upserting a user record, but no work e-mail address provided in BambooHR:
    `No Azure actions taken because 'Work Email' not provided.`
9.  When updating a user record:
    `Updating ${employee.fields.First name Last name} (${employee.fields.Employee #} information...`
10.  When employment status does not comply with criteria requirements for integration:
    `No Azure changes made. Employment Status does not qualify for integration. Nothing to update for ${employee.fields.First name Last name} (${employee.fields.Employee #} at      this time.`
11. When Employee ID and User Principle Name do not match:
    `${employee.fields.First name Last name} User Principal Name ($UserPrincipalName}) and Bamboo Work Email ({$employee.Work Email}) do not match. Please review this employee      {employee.Employee #} to confirm the email and UPN are correct.`
12. When a user is not found a new user is created succesfully:
    `Creating a new user for ${employee.fields.First name Last name} ...`

### Authorization with Azure
OpenFn is leveraging the adaptor `language-http` to connect with the `Microsoft Graph API` in order to perform operations in Azure AD and across other Microsoft products. **See API Docs:** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/

1. We are authorizing with Azure AD `on behalf of a user` - [see docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-user?context=graph/api/1.0)
2. To enable this, Admin users needs to grant `Delegated Permissions` via the API Permissions menu item in the [Azure AD Portal](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.checklist=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/CallAnAPI/appId/a699c0b6-e5c2-4d12-9350-5f5f13154a06/isMSAApp/)

### Solution Roadmap 
Discussed functionality may include: 
1. Additional automated actions when a user is terminated (consider integration with Jira or Microsoft form to trigger this? 
2. Syncing of profile photos
3. Two-way sync capabilities
4. Conversion of special characters
